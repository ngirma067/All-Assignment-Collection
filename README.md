## Individual Assignment One

## Smaller-Number-In-Array
## Algorithm
1. Initialize the smallest number with the first element of the array.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3. Compare each element with the current smallest number.
4. Update the smallest number if a smaller element is found.
5. Return the smallest number after checking all elements.

# The-second-largest-number
## Algorithm
1. Initialize two variables, largest and secondLargest, with the smallest possible integer value (e.g., INT_MIN).
2. Iterate through the array.
3. For each element:
   - If the element is greater than largest, update secondLargest to the old largest, and then update largest to the current element.
   - If the element is less than largest but greater than secondLargest, update secondLargest.
4. Return secondLargest after iterating through the entire array.

# Pointer-Sorting-Algorithm-using-Insertion-Sort-
## Student Information
- **Name**: Natnael Girma
- **Student ID**: 0425/23
- **Course**: DSA
## Algorithm
- Function Definition:
The insertionSort function takes an array (arr[]) and its size (n) as arguments.
It iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
-Key Element:
For each element (arr[i]), it is compared to the elements before it.
This element (key) is temporarily stored, and a pointer (ptr) is created to refer to it
- Shifting Larger Elements:
The algorithm shifts elements that are larger than the key element to the right. This "shifting" happens in the inner while loop: while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key).
- Placing the Key Element:
Once the correct position is found for the key element, it is inserted in the correct position, and the next element is processed.
- Helper Function pr:
The pr function is used to print the array before and after sorting.
## Time Complexity:

- **Best Case**: O(n) when the array is already sorted. In this case, only the outer loop runs, and the inner loop doesn't perform any shifts.
- **Worst Case**: O(n²) when the array is sorted in reverse order. Each element will need to be compared with all previously sorted elements.
- **Average Case**: O(n²) for random data, because every element might require shifting.
  
## Summary:

- Insertion Sort works by building up a sorted section of the array one element at a time.
- The use of pointers here (*ptr = &arr[i]) demonstrates how pointers can be used to access and modify elements in the array.
- This implementation works well for small to moderately sized datasets but is inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n²) time complexity.
